# Unreal_FASTBuild
Allows the usage of FASTBuild with Unreal Engine 4 with a few minor modifications. It supports Visual Studio 2015 and the Windows 10 SDK and UE4 4.15, although you should be able to use this with previous versions of UE4 by looking at the history of the file.

Read the [Integration Guide](integration-guide.md) for how to modify your engine to integrate FASTBuild.
